## üéØ About Me

**Mindful Development. Focused on Simplicity, Privacy, and Intentional Design.**
I am dedicated to mastering **Android development (Java)**, focusing on how to build tools that respect user attention and uphold **privacy by design**.

### My Approach

* **Deep System Focus:** Moving from UI to core architecture to ensure solutions are not just functional but also robust and stable.
* **User-Centric Commitment:** My goal is to create applications that truly serve users by solving real problems without introducing new distractions.
* **Ethical Priority:** I actively prioritize **user wellbeing** and **minimalism** over constant engagement metrics.

### *"Quiet design speaks louder than cluttered noise"*

I believe technology should always enhance life without demanding constant attention or compromising fundamental privacy. I strive to build natural, seamless experiences‚Äîholding that the most effective interface is often the one you don't even notice.

**Core Values:**

| Value | Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Simplicity** | Maximum focus through minimal features. |
| **Privacy** | Empowering users with data ownership. |
| **Calm Technology** | Tools that perform quietly and effectively. |
| **Transparency** | Supporting open source for community trust. |

## üìö Current Path

**Thoughtful Learning. Foundational Depth.**
I'm focusing on methodical learning, prioritizing deep understanding over speed. My current exploration includes:

- **Android app architecture** and lifecycle patterns
- **Java best practices** and clean code principles
- **Privacy-preserving** development techniques
- Building apps that work **offline-first**
- Understanding how apps function at the system level

My aim is to build a portfolio of small, focused projects that demonstrate **privacy-first design** with minimal interfaces‚Äîeach solving a specific problem without unnecessary complexity.
