## üéØ About Me

**Mindful Development. Focused on Simplicity, Privacy, and Intentional Design.**

I'm dedicated to mastering **Android development (Java)**, focusing on how to build tools that respect user attention and uphold **privacy by design**.

### My Approach

* **Deep System Focus:** Moving from UI to core architecture to ensure solutions are not just functional but also robust and stable.
* **User-Centric Commitment:** My goal is to create applications that truly serve users by solving real problems without introducing new distractions.
* **Ethical Priority:** I actively prioritize **user wellbeing** and **minimalism** over constant engagement metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I'm Working With

```java
public class Developer {
    String language = "Java";
    String platform = "Android";
    String[] interests = {"Privacy", "Minimal Design", "Clean Code"};
    String philosophy = "Build tools that respect users";
}
```

I believe technology should enhance life without demanding constant attention or compromising privacy. I strive to build natural, seamless experiences. The most effective interface is often the one you don't even notice.

**Core Values:**

<table align="center">
<tr>
<td width="25%"><b>Simplicity</b></td>
<td width="75%">Maximum focus through minimal features.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Privacy</b></td>
<td>Empowering users with data ownership.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Calm Technology</b></td>
<td>Tools that perform quietly and effectively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Transparency</b></td>
<td>Supporting open source for community trust.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## üìö Current Path

**Thoughtful Learning. Foundational Depth.**

I'm focusing on methodical learning, prioritizing deep understanding over speed. My current exploration includes:

- Android app architecture and lifecycle patterns
- Java best practices and clean code principles
- Privacy-preserving development techniques
- Building apps that work offline-first
- Understanding how apps function at the system level

My aim is to build a portfolio of small, focused projects that demonstrate privacy-first design with minimal interfaces. Each solving a specific problem without unnecessary complexity.
